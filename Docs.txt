That sounds like a fantastic project! To develop a system for a creative industries program, you'll want to approach it in a structured way. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you get started, along with some additional feature ideas:

### **1. Define Requirements and Scope**

- **User Roles:** Identify different user roles (students, instructors, mentors, administrators) and their specific needs.
- **Core Features:**
  - **Student Management:** Enrollment, profiles, and attendance tracking.
  - **Class Scheduling:** Manage and view class schedules.
  - **Job Tracker:** Track job applications, interviews, and job offers.
  - **Mentorship Booking:** Schedule and manage mentorship sessions.
  - **Progress Reporting:** Track and report on student progress and achievements.

### **2. Design the System**

- **Wireframes and Mockups:** Create wireframes to map out the user interface and user experience (UI/UX).
- **Database Schema:** Design a database schema to manage data related to students, classes, job applications, etc.
- **Architecture:** Plan the architecture of the system, including frontend, backend, and any integrations.

### **3. Choose Technology Stack**

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.js).
- **Backend:** Node.js, Python (Django or Flask), Ruby on Rails, or PHP.
- **Database:** MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB.
- **Hosting and Deployment:** AWS, Azure, or Heroku.

### **4. Develop the System**

- **Frontend Development:** Build the user interfaces based on your wireframes.
- **Backend Development:** Create APIs and handle data management, authentication, and business logic.
- **Database Management:** Implement and integrate the database with your backend.
- **Testing:** Conduct thorough testing (unit tests, integration tests, and user acceptance testing).

### **5. Deployment and Maintenance**

- **Deployment:** Deploy your system to a production environment.
- **Monitoring:** Set up monitoring and logging to track system performance and issues.
- **Maintenance:** Regular updates and bug fixes.

### **6. Extra Features to Consider**

- **Notifications:** Email or SMS notifications for class schedules, mentorship sessions, and job application updates.
- **Analytics Dashboard:** Provide insights and reports for administrators and mentors to track overall program effectiveness.
- **Resource Library:** Offer resources like tutorials, guides, and best practices relevant to digital skills.
- **Feedback System:** Allow students and mentors to provide feedback on classes and mentorship sessions.
- **Integration with External Tools:** Integrate with tools like Google Calendar for scheduling or LinkedIn for job tracking.
- **Gamification:** Add elements like badges or achievements to motivate students and track their progress.
- **Mobile Compatibility:** Ensure the system is responsive and works well on mobile devices.
- **Accessibility:** Make sure the system is accessible to users with disabilities, following guidelines like WCAG.

### **7. Gather Feedback and Iterate**

- **User Testing:** Collect feedback from users (students, instructors, mentors) and make necessary adjustments.
- **Continuous Improvement:** Regularly update and improve the system based on user feedback and evolving needs.

By following these steps and incorporating additional features, you can create a comprehensive and valuable tool for the creative industries program. If you have specific questions about any part of the process or need further details, feel free to ask!
